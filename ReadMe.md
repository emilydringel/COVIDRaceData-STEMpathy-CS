This project is meant to teach high school computer science students introductory CS concepts, while exploring how the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic impacted Black Americans. Teachers may choose to use some of the code provided here to target subjects being taught in class or have students build a similar program from scratch.

Note: The data is this set is only based on people with access to tests, therefore it may not be entirely accurate, likely the difference is even more when you consider who could get tests.


Data from:  https://covidtracking.com/race.
To use updated data, go to the above site, and make sure to delete the top 3 rows and the last column (with notes in it) before parsing, as the information in these rows will throw an error. 

Questions:
1. What percentage of Black Americans tested positive for COVID? What percentage of White Americans tested positive for COVID? What is the ratio between these percentages?
2. Pick a state. Answer the above questions for that state. (Bonus: Compare with your classmates, which state had the highest difference in percentages?)
3. Pick a day. Answer the above questions for that day. Note that not all days have data, if you get a day with nothing, try another. (Bonus: allow for command line input of a day)
4. (Bonus question:) In Illinois and Kansas (where this data was tracked) what percentage of tests for Black Americans were positive? What percentage for White Americans? What does this tell you about who had access to tests in the first place and potential problems with this data?

Discussion Question: What can you infer based on this data? Why do you think this disparity exists?
